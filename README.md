# iTest
iTest is a series of eye tests help you to quickly and accurately check your eye health, so you can decide if it's time to see your optometrist. It helps the user check unique muscles or cranial nerves from the brainstem to the orbit, in the brainstem nuclei, or in the higher-order centers and pathways in the cortex and brainstem that control eye movements.
